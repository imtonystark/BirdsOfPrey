An adaptation of Super Star Trek for the Android platform, written in Lua using the Corona SDK.
This project is still in development. The game should render properly on most android devices.
Support for IOS has not yet been tested, and may be addressed at a later time. 

I'm working with Corona Simulator for testing and development, however a .jar package of the latest
build can be found here (in the jar directory) if needed.
